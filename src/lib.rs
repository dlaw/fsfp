//! This crate provides fixed-point arithmetic with _statically verified_
//! overflow safety and bit shift correctness.
//!
//! Fixed-point arithmetic represents fractional values as integers with
//! an implicit bit shift.  For example, the decimal number 2.375 (in base 2: 10.011) could
//! be represented in fixed-point as the integer `0b10011` (decimal 19) with an implicit bit shift of 3.  It is
//! the programmer's responsibility to keep track of all the bit shifts used in a program,
//! ensure they are consistent with each other, and avoid any overflows during
//! arithmetic operations.
//!
//! In contrast, floating-point numbers automatically adjust the "bit shift" (i.e. the exponent)
//! to provide the largest possible resolution which will not overflow.
//! They are easy to use, and they do the right thing most of
//! the time.  However, they can cause subtle rounding bugs which are famously difficult
//! to identify and prevent.  In the immortal words of Professor Gerald Sussman,
//! "Nothing brings fear to my heart more than a floating-point number."
//!
//! This crate uses the Rust type system to provide fixed-point numbers with compile-time
//! bit shift checking and overflow protection.  Each fixed-point type has two const generic
//! parameters, one describing the bit shift and one describing the maximum
//! number of bits which could be nonzero.  Each arithmetic operation is implemented with
//! an output type which correctly reflects the bits and shift of the result.  For example,
//! the result of multiplying a 10-bit number (shifted by 2) and a 12-bit number (shifted by 3)
//! is a 22-bit number (shifted by 5).
//!
//! The trait `Fp` represents any fixed-point number stored as an
//! integer, and the structs `FpXxx<const BITS: u32, const SHIFT: i32>` implement the
//! `Fp` trait for each integer type `Xxx`.  Arithmetic operations on the fixed-point
//! types are guaranteed to provide correctness and overflow safety with zero runtime
//! overhead.
//!
//! It is necessary to use nightly Rust in order to enable the unstable
//! `generic_const_exprs` feature.  Otherwise it would not be possible to specify
//! the correct return type from most operations.
